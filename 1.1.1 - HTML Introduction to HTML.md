# 1.1.1 - HTML: Introduction to HTML

## What is HTML?

* HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
	* HyperText - Text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links... hyperlinks.
	* Markup Language - A computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.


### HTML Anatomy

* HTML is made up of elements. These elements structure the webpage and define its content. Some definitions for the features:
	* HTML element: A unit of content in HTML, formed by HTML tags and all the media it contains.
	* HTML Tag: the element name, surrounded by brackets <like this>


### The Body

* The body element `<body> </body>` contains everything that is displayed on the webpage.

### HTML Structure
 
* Headings - Use `<h1> - <h6>` for headings in HTML. H1 is typically for the main page title and is only used once per page.
* Divs - `<div> </div>` is short for 'division' and its a container that divides the page into sections. These sections are very useful for grouping elements in HTML together.
* Paragraphs `<p> </p>` - Used for a block of plain text.
* Span `<span> </span>` - contains a short piece of text or other HTML which can be formatted in a different way.
* Use `<strong> </strong>` to bold text.
* Use `<em> </em>` to Italicise text.
* Use `<br>` for line breaks to show in browser.


## Lists

### Unordered Lists
Unordered lists (in their default form) will be bullet points. They are structured as such:

```html
<ul>
	<li>List Item 1</li>
	<li>List Item 2</li>
	<li>List Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

### Ordered Lists

Ordered lists appear as numbers, used in step by step instructions.

```html
<ol>
  <li>Step 1</li>
  <li>Step 2</li>
</ol>
```

## Images

Images are placed in a webpage by using the self closing <img> tag. With both src (source) and alt tags it looks like this:

`<img src="myfile.jpg" alt="A picture of a panda">`

The alt attribute also serves the following purposes:

* If an image fails to load on a web page, a user can mouse over the area originally intended for the image and read a brief description of the image. This is made possible by the description you provide in the alt attribute.
* Visually impaired users often browse the web with the aid of screen reading software. When you include the alt attribute, the screen reading software can read the image's description out loud to the visually impaired user.
* The alt attribute also plays a role in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), because search engines cannot "see" the images on websites as they crawl the internet. Having descriptive alt attributes can improve the ranking of your site.

## Videos

Videos are similar to images in that they require a src tag to link to the source video. However, it should be noted that videos do not have self closing tags. A video element will look like this:

`<video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls> Video not supported </video>`

* In this example, the video source is myVideo.mp4.
* The width and height attributes are used to set the size of the video displayed in the browser.
* The controls attribute instructs the browser to include basic video controls: pause, play and skip.
* The text, "Video not supported", between the opening and closing video tags will only be displayed if the browser is unable to load the video.
