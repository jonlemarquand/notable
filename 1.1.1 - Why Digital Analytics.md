# 1.1.1 - Why Digital Analytics?

People usually purchase goods in stages.
* Purchase Funnel:
	* Acquisition - Building Awareness
	* Behaviour - Users engage with the business
	* Conversion - When a user becomes a customer and interacts
* With analytics we can track what online behaviour led to purchases and use that data to make informed decisions about how to reach new and existing customers.
* *Digital Analytics in Practice*
	* Think about an online store, such as the Google Merchandise Store. It might have a goal to sell more t-shirts. Using digital analytics, the store could collect and analyze data from their online advertising campaigns to see which are most effective and expand those marketing efforts.
		* For example, the store could analyze geographical sales data to understand if people in certain places buy a lot of shirts and then run additional advertising campaigns in those areas. They could also use analytics to understand how users progress through their online shopping cart. If they notice that users have trouble with a particular step on their website, they can make changes to the site to resolve the problem.
