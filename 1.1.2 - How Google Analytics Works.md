# 1.1.2 - How Google Analytics Works

## Tracking a Website
 
 
* To track a website, you need to add a small piece of Javascript tracking code to each page on your site.
* Every time a user visits a webpage, the tracking code will collect anonymous information about how that user interacted with the page.
	* The tracking code could show how many users visited a page that sells drink ware versus a page that sells houseware or it could tell us how many users bought an item by tracking whether they made it to the purchase confirmation page.
	* The tracking code will also collect information from the browser like the language the browser is set to, the type of browser, and the device and operating system used to access the site.
	* It can even collect the “traffic source,” which is what brought users to the site in the first place.
		* This might be a search engine, an advertisement they clicked on, or an email marketing campaign.
* Every time a page loads, the tracking code will collect and send updated information about the user’s activity. Google Analytics groups this activity into a period of time called a “session."
	* A session begins when a user navigates to a page that includes the Google Analytics tracking code.
	* A session ends after 30 minutes of inactivity.
	* If the user returns to a page after a session ends, a new session will begin.

## Processing and Reporting
 
 
* But there are also configuration settings that allow you to customize how that data is processed. For example, you might want to apply a filter to make sure your data doesn’t include any internal company traffic, or only includes data from a particular country or region that’s important to your business.
* *Once Analytics processes the data, it’s stored in a database where it can’t be changed*
