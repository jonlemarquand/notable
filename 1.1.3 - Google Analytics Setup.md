# 1.1.3 - Google Analytics Setup

## The Analytics Account Structure

* All of your Google Analytics accounts can be grouped under an “Organization,” which is optional. This allows you to manage multiple Google Analytics accounts under one grouping.
* Large businesses or agencies could have multiple accounts, while, medium to small-sized businesses generally (only) use one account. When you create an account, you also automatically create a property and, within that property, a view for that account. But each Analytics account can have multiple properties and each property can have multiple views. This lets you organize your Analytics data collection in a way that best reflects your business.
* The Google Analytics Account determines how data is collected from your websites and manages who can access that data. Typically, you would create separate Analytics accounts for distinct businesses or business units.
* Each Google Analytics account has at least one “property.” Each property can collect data independently of each other using a unique tracking ID that appears in your tracking code.
* You may assign multiple properties to each account, so you can collect data from different websites, mobile applications, or other digital assets associated with your business. For example, you may want to have separate properties for different sales regions or different brands. This allows you to easily view the data for an individual part of your business, but keep in mind this won’t allow you to see data from separate properties in aggregate.

## View Settings
 
 
* Just as each account can have multiple “properties,” each property can have multiple “views.
	* You can use Filters in your configuration settings to determine what data you want to include in the reports for each view.
	* For example, The Google Store sells merchandise from their website across different geographical regions. They could create one view that includes all of their global website data. But if they wanted to see data for individual regions, they could create separate views for North America, Europe and Asia.
		* You could also filter out internal traffic based on IP address.
* The view level also lets you set Google Analytics “Goals”.
	* Goals are a valuable way to track conversions, or business objectives, from your website.
	* A goal could be how many users signed up for an email newsletter, or how many users purchased a product.
* It is important to note that new views will not include past data.

## User Permissions
 
 
* You can assign permissions to other users at the account, property, or view level. Each level inherits permissions from the level above it.
	* For example, if you have access to an account, then you have the same access permissions to the properties and views underneath that account.
