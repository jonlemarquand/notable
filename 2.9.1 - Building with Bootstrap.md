# 2.9.1 - Building with Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework with prewritten CSS rules designed to help you build webpages faster.

*Connecting to Bootstrap*

Before Bootstrap can work for us, we need to link to it.

In earlier lessons, we linked only to main.css. Now, in addition to main.css, we will link to a URL that hosts Bootstrap.

The HTML link element makes Bootstrap available to us. Remember that the link element is typically contained within HTML head tags.

<head>
…
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>
…
</head>

Above, the href attribute is set to the URL https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css.

*On the Grid*

One of the reasons Bootstrap and frameworks like it are so popular is because they offer grids. A grid makes it possible to organize HTML elements using preconfigured columns. Using a grid, you can customize responsive page layouts quickly and reliably.

The Bootstrap grid contains 12 equal-sized columns, as seen in the diagram on the right. HTML elements are arranged to span different numbers of columns in order to create custom page layouts.

*Header/Navigation*

Let’s use Bootstrap’s grid to create a simple header with navbar.

In the example code below, an HTML header element with Bootstrap’s predefined container class is used:

<header class="container”>
…
</header>

Inside the header, a row is created by using a div with Bootstrap’s row class:

<header class="container”>
<div class="row"> </div>
</header>

Finally, the row is cut into two parts:

<header class="container”>
<div class="row”>
<h1 class="col-sm-4">Heading</h1>
<nav class="col-sm-8 text-right”>
<p>nav item 1</p>
<p>nav item 2</p>
<p>nav item 3</p> </nav>
</div>
</header>

The first part consists of the h1 with Bootstrap’s class col-sm-4. It will take up the first four columns on the grid. The second part consists of the nav element with class col-sm-8. It will take up the remaining eight grid columns. text-right indicates that text will be arranged on the right side of the nav.

# The Jumbotron

In addition to a header/navigation, many websites have a large showcase area featuring important content. Bootstrap refers to this as a jumbotron. Below is an example implementation of a jumbotron.
First, a new section element is created and assigned the jumbotron class:
<section class="jumbotron”>
</section>
Next a div with the Bootstrap class container is used:
<section class="jumbotron”>
<div class="container”>
…
</div>
</section>
A div with the Bootstrap class row text-center can center subsequent child elements which will contain text:
<section class="jumbotron”>
<div class="container”>
<div class="row text-center”>
…
</div>
</div>
</section>
The ... is a placeholder for HTML elements containing text, such as h2, p or anchor elements.
