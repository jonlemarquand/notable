## Console

The console is a tool that developers use to record the output of their JavaScript programs. The console.log() command is used to print, or log, text to the console:

i.e. 
```javascript
console.log("Hello!‚Äù);
```

## Data Types

Data types are the building blocks of all languages and essential pieces of any program.

Primitive data types, as their name implies, are he simplest built-in forms of data. The types include:

- Strings
Any grouping of keyboard characters (letters, spaces, numbers or symbols) surrounded by single quotes ('Hello') or double quotes ("World").
- Numbers
Any number, including numbers with decimals: 4, 1516, .002, 23.42.
- Booleans
Either true or false, with no quotations.
- Null
Can only be null.
It represents the absense of value.

Math Operators

Javascript supports the following math operators:

- Add +
- Subtract -
- Multiply *
- Divide /

Properties

When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program, the browser saves it as an instance of the data type. An instance is an individual case (or object) of a data type.

JavaScript will save a new piece of data, like 'Hello', as a string instance in the computer's memory. Another example, the number 40.7, is stored as an instance of the number data type.

An instance, like the string 'Hello', has additional information attached to it. For example, every string instance has a property called length that stores the number of characters in it. You can retrieve property information by appending the string with a period and the property name:

console.log('Hello'.length);

In the example above, the value saved to the length property is retrieved from the string, 'Hello'. The program prints 5 to the console, because Hello has five characters in it.

Built-in Methods

While the length of a string is calculated when an instance is created, a string instance also has methods that calculate new information as needed. When these built-in methods are called on an instance, they perform actions that generate an output.

Built-in methods are called, or used, by appending an instance with a period, the name of the method, and opening (() and closing ()) parentheses. Consider the examples below:

console.log('Hello'.toUpperCase()); // 'HELLO'
console.log('Hey'.startsWith('H')); // true

Let's look at each line separately:

On the first line, the .toUpperCase() method is called on the string instance 'Hello'. The result is logged to the console. This method returns a string in all capital letters: 'HELLO'.

On the second line, the .startsWith() method is called on the string instance "Hey". This method also accepts the character 'H' as an input between the opening and closing parentheses. Since the string 'Hey' does start with the letter 'H', the method returns the boolean true.

You can find a list of built-in string methods in the JavaScript documentation. Developers use documentation as a reference tool. It describes JavaScript's keywords, methods, and syntax.

Libraries

Instance methods, by definition, require that you create an instance before you can use them. What if you want to call a method without an instance? That's where JavaScript libraries come in. Libraries contain methods that you can call without creating an instance.

Comments

Programs do not evaluate comments when you run them. In other words, they exist just for human readers. Good comments are useful for you and other developers, because they describe what the code does. There are two types of code comments in JavaScript:

// A single line comment

/*
A multi-line comment
filters out all comments like this.
*/
