# 3.1.2 - Variables
Variables

Programmers use variables to write code that is easy to understand and repurpose. Variables allow us to assign data to a word and use the word to reference the data. If the data changes, we can replace the variable's value instead of re-writing the program.

const

Here is how you declare a constant variable:

const myName = 'Jon';
console.log(myName);
//Output: Jon

let

Let variables, unlike constant variables, can be reassigned. For example:

let meal = 'Enchiladas';
console.log(meal);
meal = 'Tacos';
console.log(meal);
// output: Enchiladas
// output: Tacos

In the example above, the let keyword is used to create the meal variable with the string 'Enchiladas' saved to it. On line three, the meal variable is changed to store the string 'Tacos'.

You may be wondering, when to use const vs let. In general, only use const if the value saved to a variable does not change in your program.

undefined

JavaScript assigns the undefined data type to variables that are not assigned a value.

let whatAmI;

In the example above, we created the variable whatAmI without any value assigned to it. JavaScript creates the variable and sets it equal to the value undefined.

Mathematical Assignment Operators

we can use variables and math operators to calculate new values and assign them to a variable. Check out the example below:

let x = 4;
x = x + 1;

In the example above, we created the variable x with the number 4 assigned to it. On the following line, x = x + 1 increases the value of x from 4 to 5.

Notice, on line two in the example above, to increment x by one we had to write the x variable on the left and right side of the assignment operator (=). Using a variable twice in one expression is redundant and confusing.

To address this, JavaScript has a collection of built-in mathematical assignment operators that make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable without writing the variable twice. See examples of these operators below.

let x = 4;
x += 2; // x equals 6

let y = 4;
y -= 2; // y equals 2

let z = 4;
z *= 2; // z equals 8

let r = 4;
r++; // r equals 5

let t = 4;
t--; // t equals 3

In the example above, operators are used to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable. Let's consider the first three and last two operators separately:

The first three operators (+=, -=, and *=) perform the mathematical operation of the first operator (+, -, or *) using the number on the right, then assign the new value to the variable.
The last two operators are the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators. These operators are responsible for increasing and decreasing a number variable by one, respectively.

String Interpolation

The JavaScript term for inserting the data saved to a variable into a string is string interpolation.

The + operator, known until now as the addition operator, is used to interpolate (insert) a string variable into a string, as follows:

let myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log('I own a pet ' + myPet + '.');
// Output: 'I own a pet armadillo.'

In the example above, we saved the value 'armadillo' to the myPet variable. On the second line, the + operator is used to combine three strings: I own a pet, the value saved to myPet, and .. We log the result of this interpolation to the console as:

I own a pet armadillo.

In the newest version of JavaScript (ES6) we can insert variables into strings with ease, by doing two things:

Instead of using quotes around the string, use backticks (this key is usually located on the top of your keyboard, left of the 1 key).

Wrap your variable with ${myVariable}, followed by a sentence. No +s necessary.

ES6 string interpolation is easier than the method you used last exercise. With ES6 interpolation we can insert variables directly into our text.

It looks like this:

let myPet = 'armadillo'
console.log( ` I own a pet ${myPet}. ` )
// Output: 'I own a pet armadillo.'

In the example above, the backticks ( ` ) wrap the entire string. The variable (myPet) is inserted using ${}. The resulting string is:

I own a pet armadillo.
