# 6.1.1 - Git: Basic Git Workflow
Git is a software that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time. Git works by recording the changes you make to a project, storing these changes, then allowing you to reference them as needed.

If we to work on a Screenplay for example:

1. Enter text for the screenplay.
2. In the terminal use 'git init'.

Init means initialise. The command sets up all the tools Git needs to begin tracking changes made to the project.

*Git Workflow*

A Git project can be thought of as having three parts:

1. A Working Directory: where you'll be doing all the work, creatining, editing, deleting and organising files.
2. A Staging area: Where you'll list changes you make to the working directory.
3. A Repository: Where Git permanently stores these changes as different versions of the project.

Git status

As you write the screenplay, you will be changing the contents of the working directory. You can check the status of those changes with:

git status

Git add

In order for Git to start tracking scene-1.txt, the file needs to be added to the staging area. We can add a file to the staging area with:

git add filename

In the output, notice that Git indicates the changes to be committed with "new file: scene-1.txt" in green text. Here Git tells us the file was added to the staging area.

Git diff

If we typed another line in scene-1.txt. Since the file is tracked, we can check the differences between the working directory and the staging area with:

git diff filename

Notice the output:

"Harry Programmer and the Sorcerer's Code: Scene 1" is in the staging area, as indicated in white.
Changes to the file are marked with a + and are indicated in green.

Git commit

A commit is the last step in our Git workflow. A commit permanently stores changes from the staging area inside the repository.

-m followed by a message e.g. -m "Complete first line of dialogue" This adds a message to the commit. Standard conventions for commit messages:

- Must be in quotation marks.
- Written in the present tense.
- Should be brief (50 characters or less) when using -m.

An example of the full commit command:

git commit -m "Complete first line of dialogue"

Git log

Often with Git, you'll need to refer back to an earlier version of a project. Commits are stored chronologically in the repository and can be viewed with:

git log.

In the output you'll see:

- A 40-character code, called a SHA, that uniquely identifies the commit. This appears in orange text.
- The commit author (you!)
- The date and time of the commit.
- The commit message
