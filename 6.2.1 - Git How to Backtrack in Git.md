# 6.2.1 - Git: How to Backtrack in Git
*head commit*

In Git, the commit you are currently on is known as the HEAD commit. In many cases, the most recently made commit is the HEAD commit. To see the HEAD commit, enter:

git show HEAD

The output of this command will display everything the git log command displays for the HEAD commit, plus all the file changes that were committed.
In the output, the most recently added line would be in green text.

*git checkout*

If you decide to change a line in the working directory, but then decide you want to discard that change, how would you go about that?

You could rewrite the line how it was originally, but you may forget the exact wording. The command:

git checkout HEAD filename

will restore the file in your working directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit.

more git add

In Git, it's common to change many files, add those files to the staging area, and commit them to a repository in a single commit. After you change multiple files, you can add them to the staging area by using:

git add filename_1 filename_2

git reset I

What if, before you commit, you accidentally delete an important line from scene-2.txt? Unthinkingly, you add scene-2.txt to the staging area. The file change is unrelated to the other changes and you don't want to include it in the commit. We can unstage that file from the staging area using:

git reset HEAD filename

This command resets the file in the staging area to be the same as the HEAD commit. It does not discard file changes from the working directory, it just removes them from the staging area.

git reset II

Git also enables you to rewind to the part before you made the wrong turn. You can do this with:

git reset comit_SHA

This command works by using the first 7 characters of the SHA of a previous commit. For example, if the SHA of the previous commit is 5d692065cf51a2f50ea8e7b19b5a7ae512f633ba, use:

git reset 5d69206

HEAD is now set to that previous commit.
