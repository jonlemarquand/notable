# 6.3.1 - Git: Branching
#git/branching #PD - Codecademy#

## git branch
Up to this point, you’ve worked in a single Git branch called master. Git allows us to create branches to experiment with versions of a project. Imagine you want to create version of a story with a happy ending. You can create a new branch and make the happy ending changes to that branch only. It will have no effect on the master branch until you’re ready to merge the happy ending to the master branch.

In this lesson, we’ll be using Git branching to develop multiple versions of a resumé.

You can use the command below to answer the question: “which branch am I on?”

`git branch`

Right now, the Git project has only one branch: master.

To create a new branch, use:

`git branch new_branch`

Here new_branch would be the name of the new branch you create, like photos or blurb. Be sure to name your branch something that describes the purpose of the branch. Also, branch names can’t contain whitespaces: new-branch and new_branch are valid branch names, but new branch is not.

*git checkout*

Great! You just created a new branch.

The master and fencing branches are identical: they share the same exact commit history. You can switch to the new branch with

`git checkout branch_name`

Here, branch_name is the name of the branch. If the branch’s name is skill

`git checkout skill`

Once you switch branch, be now able to make commits on the branch that have no impact on master.

You can continue your workflow, while master stays intact!

*commit on a new branch*

Congratulations! You have switched to a new branch. All the commands you do on master, you can also do on this branch.

For example, to add files to the staging area, use:

git add filename

And to commit, use:

git commit -m "Commit message"

In a moment, you will make a commit on the fencing branch. On the far right, the diagram shows what will happen to the Git project.

*git merge*

What if you wanted include all the changes made to the fencing branch on the master branch? We can easily accomplish this by merging the branch into master with:

git merge branch_name

For example, if I wanted to merge the skills branch to master, I would enter

git merge skills

*merge conflict I*

The merge was successful because master had not changed since we made a commit on fencing. Git knew to simply update master with changes on fencing.

What would happen if you made a commit on master before you merged the two branches? Furthermore, what if the commit you made on master altered the same exact text you worked on in fencing? When you switch back to master and ask Git to merge the two branches, Git doesn’t know which changes you want to keep. This is called a merge conflict.

*delete branch*

In Git, branches are usually a means to an end. You create them to work on a new project feature, but the end goal is to merge that feature into the master branch. After the branch has been integrated into master, it has served its purpose and can be deleted.

The command

git branch -d branch_name

will delete the specified branch from your Git project.

Now that master contains all the file changes that were in fencing, let’s delete fencing.
