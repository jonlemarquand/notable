# 86-89 - What is JavaScript?

3 Different Ways to add Javascript

* In-line JavaScript
	* onclick=“ “ inside the < > quote
		* e.g. <button onclick=“alert(‘Hi!’)”>Click Me!</button>
	* Easy to get up and running but messy overall.
		* Want to keep logic/JavaScript separate to content.
* Internal JavaScript
	* <script type=“test/javascript"> </script>
		* alert (‘Page is loaded!’)
	* Use double quotes initially than single quotes inside them.
	* JavaScript also has an optional semi-colon at the end.
	* Chrome console
		* Can run JavaScript on the page itself.
		* More usefully, it will show you if you have errors in your JavaScript
	* Script code can be in the head, but usually at the bottom of the body.
