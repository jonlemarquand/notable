# JDSD - Extra Bits

## Complexity vs Simplicity

* Always choose simplicity.
  * Too often developers choose cool new tricks or features just to show off.
  * Writing good code is:
    * Self-documenting.
    * Clear and concise.
  
## NPM is Not Your Friend

* npm install is not your answer.
  * Ask: Why do I need this library? Is it worth the size of the package that we need to deploy?
  * How big is the library and will it really increase the value of the project?

## Learn to Learn

* The most successful people are better learners.
  * Not a contest with others, contest with yourself.
  * Figure out your best learning style.

## Start with Why

* Why are we learning this? WHy is this worth my time?
  * There's always new things in the developer ecosystem but they come and go.
  * The things that stick around are the fundamental computer science topics.
* Don't be constantly trying to chase the new framework.
  * See the entire ecosystem rather than the new shiny thing.
