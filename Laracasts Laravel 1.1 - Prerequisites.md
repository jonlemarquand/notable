# Laracasts Laravel 1.1 - Prerequisites

* Controller -> Model -> View
* Controller
  * The request comes in to the routes and then we load the controller.
  * The controller then delegates all the information necessary to generate a response.
* Eloquent Model
  * Eloquent Model provides an API for SQL queries, but also a location for business logic.
* View
  * What the user sees on the page.
  * The view receives the data from the controller and renders it for the user.

To start a server: `php artisan serve`
