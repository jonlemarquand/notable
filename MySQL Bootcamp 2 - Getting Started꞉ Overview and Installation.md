# MySQL Bootcamp 2 - Getting Started: Overview and Installation

## What is a Database?

* A collection of data:
  * A filing cabinet full of medical records
  * A roladex of contact info
  * A to-do list
  * A Phone book
* A Method for accessing and manipulating that data.
  * Think of a phonebook, and how you would:
    * Find People with first name 'Ned'
    * Find people with a certain area code

A structured set of computersied data with an accesible interface.

### Database vs Database Management System

* A collection of data and having an interface for that data.
* Your App --> DBMS --> Database
* When people talk about database they also talk about DBMS and Database combined.

## MySQL vs. SQL

* SQL: Structured Query Language.
  * It's the language we use to "talk" to our databases.
  * We run these lines, it talks to our database and executes the command.
  * It has its own syntax.
* When we work with MySQL, we are primarily working with SQL language.
  * There are slight differences in the syntax, but that will be covered.
  * There is also an SQL standard.

* Once you learn SQL, it's pretty easy to swtich to another DB that uses SQL
* What makes databases (DBMS) unique is the features they offer rather than the language they use.
