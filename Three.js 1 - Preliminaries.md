# Three.js 1 - Preliminaries

## Maths Preliminaries
Just need enough to be able to work out geometry . You need to know:

* Co-Ordinates (X-Axis and Y-Axis)
	* distance between 2 points = square root of (x1-x2) squared + (y1 - y2) squared
	* A point represents a verctor - a line that starts at the origin and ends in the Point.
		* We denote a vector by a little line or arrow above its name.
	* Add in the Z-Axis (3, 2, -3)
	* Origin Point (0,0,0)
* Angles
	* Degrees and radians
	* Angles measured in counter-clockwise movement.
	* 180 = 3.14rad = Pi
		* radians = degrees * Pi/180

## Javascript Preliminaries
* Connect an external JS File
* Be able to use console.log
* Be able to let x = 6;
* Const  y = 10;
	* X can be changed, y canâ€™t
