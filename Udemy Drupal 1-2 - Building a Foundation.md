## Building a Foundation

### Content Types

* Drupal uses content types to group information together on a website.
* By default, Drupal comes with Article and Basic Page content types.
* Fields within content types allow you to enter information.

### Modules

* Modules are like plugins for Wordpress
* Copy the unzipped module folder into modules.
* Go to Extend tab and activate the module.

### Blocks

* Blocks are snippets of HTML code that can be placed on the website.

### Views

* Views started as a module, but it is now part of core in Drupal 8.
* Views is a content-aggregation module.
  * We can select content that we like and display it together.
  * Views is like the 'Blog homepage' or how it gets this data.

#### Setting Up a View

* Views > Add New View

#### Working with Contextual Filters

* This allows us to filter down our content by the URL we are on or some other content on the page.

### Sending it our with REST-First

* Using the REST UI Module
