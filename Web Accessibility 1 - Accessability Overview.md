# Web Accessibility 1 - Accessability Overview

* Accessible - The site is able to be accessed by everyone.
  * It generally concerns users who are expieriencing some sort of disability, and aren't able to just use the point and click method of a website.
* A desktop site on mobile, content gated by country. You've been unable to access something at some point.
* However, accessibility issues solved often improve the site for everyone.

## Understanding the Diversity of Users

* Keyboard navigation is essnetial for people with visual impairments.
  * People may also be using magnification.
  * People may also have poor colour vision.
    * 9% of males, 1% of females.
* People tend to picture someone who is blind, but actually there's a huge range of options.
* Content that uses sound should have some sort of visual alternative.

## Checklists

* WCAG - The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
  * Four core principles:
    * Perceivable
    * Operable
    * Understandable
